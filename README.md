Itadaki Street 2 Utils
======================

let's reverse _itadaki street 2_, an entry in the _fortune street_ series on the SNES, and maybe translate it?

there is a [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m-tibEic1JpQ-BRFiOMlAnN089g6XKs0ad5JFc231Ew/edit?usp=sharing) with some of the data on it, as well as some preliminary translation notes

an online clone of this repo is available on [mini.xkeeper.net](http://mini.xkeeper.net/itadaki-street-2/)
